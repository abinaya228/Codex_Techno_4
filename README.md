Autocomplete and Autocorrect Data Analytics
Project Overview

This project explores the efficiency and accuracy of autocomplete and autocorrect algorithms in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
It analyzes a large text dataset to enhance user experience and text prediction accuracy by implementing, evaluating, and comparing different models.

Objectives

Dataset Collection: Gather diverse text data (Amazon product reviews).

NLP Preprocessing: Clean and prepare text for analysis.

Autocomplete: Implement word and phrase prediction algorithms.

Autocorrect: Detect and correct spelling errors using text-based models.

Metrics: Measure accuracy and performance of models.

User Experience: Simulate user interactions for real-world testing.

Algorithm Comparison: Compare model efficiency and accuracy.

Visualization: Represent insights and results using graphical visualization.

Dataset

Name: amazon_review.csv

Source: Amazon Product Reviews Dataset on Kaggle

Columns Used: Product reviews and summaries containing text data.

Purpose: To build a real-world NLP model using large-scale user-generated content.

Project Workflow
Step 1: Import Libraries

Libraries used:

pandas, numpy – Data handling

matplotlib, wordcloud – Visualization

textblob – Autocorrect functionality

collections, re – Text pattern analysis

scikit-learn – Accuracy metrics

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Cleaned text data by removing punctuation, numbers, and stopwords.

Converted all text to lowercase.

Removed short words and irrelevant tokens.

Step 3: Autocomplete Implementation

Built an N-gram frequency model using word pairs.

Predicted the most likely next word for a given input.

Example:

Input: good
Output: ['quality', 'product', 'taste', 'price', 'service']

Step 4: Autocorrect Implementation

Used TextBlob to automatically correct misspelled words.

Compared with a simple edit-distance method for performance evaluation.

Step 5: Evaluation Metrics
Model Type	Accuracy (%)
TextBlob Autocorrect	~90
Simple Edit-Distance	~70
Step 6: Visualization

Generated a Word Cloud showing the most frequent words in the dataset.
This helped understand vocabulary patterns and prediction efficiency.

Step 7: Summary

Successfully implemented and compared Autocomplete and Autocorrect algorithms.

Improved understanding of NLP text prediction systems.

Provided metrics and visualization for data-driven evaluation.
